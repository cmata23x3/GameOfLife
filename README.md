Game of Life

Rules
=====

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Coding Challenges
========

1. Game of Life Time Display
One of the main challenges of the Game of Life project is choosing the a good way to handle generations. One possible choice is to have two board instances, 'current' and 'next'. In this case, the 'current' would be displayed and then the 'next' would be generated by applying the rules to the 'current'. Once, 'next' is created, it would be set as 'current' and then drawn. 
Another option would be to use one data structure to handle the game of life and then use functions to modify the state and apply it using closures. 
The use of a data structure would be more efficient on memory and be a better coding exercise. 

2. Graphical Interface
With the assignment, we're given flexibility in deciding which form to graphically display Conway's Game of Life. From other projects, I could use a more complex Javascript library that would present the material better, such as D3.js or two.js, but that would be more work than required. At this point, I think displaying good design and use of functional programming would be the priority, which would explain why a simple graphics library was provided. A third option to consider would be to use a DOM, such as a HTML table, display that could preemptively plan for the second phase of the assignment. 
In the end, I chose to use the graphics package that was provided. This allows me to focus on developing the Game of Life code and also provides practice with working within some given code base. 

3. Board Data Structure
To hold the cell statuses, I had the option of using either an array of arrays or an object with objects to represent each of the cells.
